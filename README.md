# Global GDP & CO₂ Emissions Analysis (1960–2022) 🌍📊

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Global GDP and CO₂ Emissions dataset from 1960 to 2022. It aims to uncover insights on the relationship between economic growth (GDP) and environmental impact (CO₂ emissions) across countries and regions.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-gdp-and-co-emissions-dataset-19602022)
- Contains metrics such as:
  - Population and GDP (USD)
  - CO₂ emissions (total, per capita, per GDP)
  - Log-transformed values
  - Categorized outliers and grouped economic/emission classes

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook (Kaggle)
- Data Cleaning & Visualization

## 📊 Key Highlights
- CO₂ and GDP growth patterns over time
- Region-wise comparisons (e.g., Asia, Europe, Africa)
- Top and bottom emitters and economic performers
- Correlation between GDP and CO₂ emissions

## 📎 Sample Visualizations
- Line plots and bar charts for trends and comparisons
- Scatter plots to assess correlation
- Region-based grouping using `groupby`

## 🔍 Project Goals
- Practice EDA with real-world data
- Understand global emission and economic patterns
- Build a strong entry-level data portfolio project
